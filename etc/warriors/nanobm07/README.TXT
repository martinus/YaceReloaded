NANO BENCHMARK 2007
-------------------

The 50 warriors here are an attempt to create a nano benchmark.  The
balance should be similar to the current hill with a little diversity
introduced.

Included for convenience are Dos batch files which use MTS to schedule
benchmarking (documented below) and the benchmark results for all nano
warriors published to date (nanobm07.txt)

BATCH BENCHMARK
---------------

This program will battle all files without an extension in the current
directory against a benchmark.  The benchmark warriors should be in the
current directory with the extension *.RED.  Stefan Strack's MTS is
required.  Filenames should be no longer than 8 characters.

If you wish to change the parameters for pMars, edit TESTXXXX.BAT. To
keep track of which files have been benchmarked, they are renamed from
*. to *.RC.  Individual results for each benchmarked warrior are
stored in *.RES. A score summary is displayed to the screen and saved
to RESULTS.TXT.
